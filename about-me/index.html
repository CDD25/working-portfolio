        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>My Journey into Tech.</h2>
        <p>My Journey into Tech began actually at 10 or 11 years old when my dad  showed me how to use the Commodore 64 Vic 20.</p>

        <p>As lifelong creative and DIY'er I've always imagined I would have a creative career in design or art of some kind.
            I decided to go to design school at one point but the cost and talent I believed I needed intimidated me.  I honestly didn't
            believe that I was good enough.  My dreams of being a paid creative fizzled away and I turned to more <em>practical</em>
            (or so I thought) paths like science and healthcare.  With a dual Bsc. in Health Sciences and Nursing I became a
            nurse in 2016.  I worked hard and grew in my role, I gained confidence quickly and became a highly compentent clinician.  But no one 
            could deny the everyday stress of actually being a nurse.  The tireless compassion you often feel for people in tough situations can wear on you.
            And when they turn on you, which they often did, nursing felt like a thankless profession.  After four years I was beaten, and jaded, but I still
            knew that medicine for me was very exciting, challenging, different everyday, and required an intense amount of critical thinking.</p>

        <p>In July 2020 working in the intensive care unit during the height of Covid, I suffered a debilitating back injury that would completely alter
            my path for the next year.  At home for months, I struggled to keep sane and busy while I waited for spine surgery.
            With my passion for creating, I began taking online classes </p>
